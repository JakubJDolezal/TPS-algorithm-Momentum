# TPS-algorithm-Momentum
We implement a transition path sampling algorithm as is defined  for example here http://geisslergroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pub2002-2.pdf in IIIB. That is a shifting algorithm. We are trying to sample a biased s-ensemble as we define here for example https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.07043.pdf. The base dynamics are an underdamped langevin and we sample it using a geometric langevin, specifically the baoab method defined in https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5428. The code is written in c++ and has been compared to LAMMPS and the base algorithm has been found rougly equivalent on our cpu with a -O3 flag speedup.
